# ===================== tmux Configuration =====================

# Set base index for panes and windows to 1
# - By default, tmux uses 0-based indexing for windows and panes.
# - This setting makes the numbering start at 1, which is more intuitive for most users.
set -g base-index 1

# ===================== Notes =====================
# - To apply changes immediately, reload the tmux configuration with:
#   `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`
# - For more customization, explore options like `set -g mouse on` for mouse support.
